Aeskulap - OpenSource DICOM Viewer
----------------------------------

http://aeskulap.nongnu.org


Aeskulap is able to load a series of special images stored in the
DICOM format for review. Additionally Aeskulap is able to query
and fetch DICOM images from archive nodes (also called PACS) over
the network.

The goal of this project is to create a full open source replacement
for commercially available DICOM viewers.

Aeskulap is based on gtkmm, glademm and gconfmm and designed to run
under Linux. Ports of these packages are available for different
platforms. It should be quite easy to port Aeskulap to any platform
were these packages are available.
