dcmdump [options] dcmfile-in...
.PP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBdcmdump\fP utility dumps the contents of a DICOM file (file format or raw data set) to stdout in textual form. Attributes with very large value fields (e.g. pixel data) can be described as '(not loaded)'. String value fields will be delimited with square brackets ([]). Known UIDs will be displayed by their names prefixed by an equals sign (e.g. '=MRImageStorage'). Empty value fields are described as '(no value available)'.
.PP
If \fBdcmdump\fP reads a raw data set (DICOM data without a file format meta- header) it will attempt to guess the transfer syntax by examining the first few bytes of the file. It is not always possible to correctly guess the transfer syntax and it is better to convert a data set to a file format whenever possible (using the \fBdcmconv\fP utility). It is also possible to use the \fI-f\fP and \fI-t[ieb]\fP options to force \fBdcmdump\fP to read a dataset with a particular transfer syntax.

printing:

  +M   --load-all
         load very long tag values (default)

  -M   --load-short
         do not load very long values (e.g. pixel data)

  +L   --print-all
         print long tag values completely

  -L   --print-short
         print long tag values shortened (default)

  +F   --print-filename
         print header with filename for each input file

error handling:

  -E   --stop-on-error
         do not print if file is damaged (default)

  +E   --ignore-errors
         attempt to print even if file is damaged

searching:

  +P   --search  [t]ag: "xxxx,xxxx" or a data dictionary name
         print the value of tag t this option can be specified
         multiple times (default: the complete file is printed)

  +s   --search-all
         print all instances of searched tags (default)

  -s   --search-first
         only print first instance of searched tags

  +p   --prepend
         prepend sequence hierarchy to printed tag,
         denoted by: (xxxx,xxxx).(xxxx,xxxx).*
         (only with --search-all or --search-first)

  -p   --no-prepend
         do not prepend hierarchy to tag (default)

writing:

  +W   --write-pixel  [d]irectory : string
         write pixel data to a .raw file stored in d
         (little endian, filename created automatically)

.SH "COMMAND LINE"
.PP
All command line tools use the following notation for parameters: square brackets enclose optional values (0-1), three trailing dots indicate that multiple values are allowed (1-n), a combination of both means 0 to n values.
.PP
Command line options are distinguished from parameters by a leading '+' or '-' sign, respectively. Usually, order and position of command line options are arbitrary (i.e. they can appear anywhere). However, if options are mutually exclusive the rightmost appearance is used. This behaviour conforms to the standard evaluation rules of common Unix shells.
.PP
In addition, one or more command files can be specified using an '@' sign as a prefix to the filename (e.g. \fI@command.txt\fP). Such a command argument is replaced by the content of the corresponding text file (multiple whitespaces are treated as a single separator) prior to any further evaluation. Please note that a command file cannot contain another command file. This simple but effective approach allows to summarize common combinations of options/parameters and avoids longish and confusing command lines (an example is provided in file \fIshare/data/dumppat.txt\fP).
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.PP
The \fBdcmdump\fP utility will attempt to load DICOM data dictionaries specified in the \fIDCMDICTPATH\fP environment variable. By default, i.e. if the \fIDCMDICTPATH\fP environment variable is not set, the file \fI<PREFIX>/lib/dicom.dic\fP will be loaded unless the dictionary is built into the application (default for Windows).
.PP
The default behaviour should be preferred and the \fIDCMDICTPATH\fP environment variable only used when alternative data dictionaries are required. The \fIDCMDICTPATH\fP environment variable has the same format as the Unix shell \fIPATH\fP variable in that a colon (':') separates entries. The data dictionary code will attempt to load each file specified in the \fIDCMDICTPATH\fP environment variable. It is an error if no data dictionary can be loaded.
