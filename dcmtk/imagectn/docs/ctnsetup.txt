SETTING UP IMAGECTN AND TI

Before attempting to setup imagectn or ti you should read the
documentation for these programs (imagectn.txt and ti.txt) as well
as the documentation on configuration (ctnconf.txt).

Step 1:

Create a directory where the image databases will be located.
e.g. 
	mkdir /home/dicom/db

Step 2:

Create subdirectories for each individual image database storage areas
to be managed by imagectn.  Each database storage area corresponds to 
an Application Entity (AE) title of imagectn.
e.g. 
	cd /home/dicom/db
	mkdir COMMON ACME_STORE UNITED_STORE

Step 3:

Copy the example configuration file (imagectn.cfg) from this 
directory (.../dcmtk/imagectn/etc) to the main image
database directory.
e.g.
	cp .../dcmtk/imagectn/etc/imagectn.cfg /home/dicom/db

Step 4:

Edit your copy of the configuration file.  You may have used
different image database directory and subdirectory names than in
the examples above.  If so, edit the AETable (near the bottom)
of your imagectn.cfg file and change the first and second columns
to reflect the names you have chosen (AE title and directory
paths).

Step 5:

Determine the hostnames, TCP/IP port numbers, and AE titles of
the DICOM applications you will be communicating with.  You need
to edit your copy of imagectn.cfg to include these in the HostTable
section.

Step 6:

Edit the VendorTable to give a string title to symbolic names
declared in the HostTable.  

Step 7:

If you wish to restrict access to image databases to particular
remote applications (peers) you need to edit the last column of the AETable
to contain a symbolic name defined in the HostTable.  If no access
restrictions are desired you can use the constant name ANY.

Step 8 (optional):

If you wish to initialize a database storage area to reference a set
of external images (e.g. the RSNA'95 image set) you can use the dbregimg
utility (in .../dcmtk/imagectn/tests/).  This step would normally only
be performed on a read-only database storage area since sending images
to such a storage area (AE title) might cause your original images to
be deleted if the quota specifications (4th column of the AETable in
imagectn.cfg) are exceeded.  
e.g.
	dbregimg -v /home/dicom/db/COMMON /home/dicom/images/rsna95/*/*/*

would register the rsna95 images in the COMMON storage area (which is defined
as read-only in imagectn.cfg).  The rsna95 images are available via ftp from
the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, St. Louis, USA :

	ftp://wuerlim.wustl.edu/pub/dicom/images/version3/RSNA95

Step 9:

You can now start the imagectn application.  
e.g.
	imagectn -v -c /home/dicom/db/imagectn.cfg 5678

will start imagectn in verbose mode, using the configuration file
you created and edited in steps 3..8, and listening on TCP/IP
port 5678.  The imagectn application will wait for DICOM association
requests and will never exit.

Step 10:

You can try sending a DICOM image to imagectn from one of the
remote machines which may access imagectn's storage areas.  
e.g.

	storescu -v --aetitle ACME1 --call ACME_STORE dbhost 5678 ctimage.dcm

will start the storescu application in verbose mode, giving it the
DICOM AE title ACME1, and requesting that it transmit the DICOM image
ctimage.dcm to the ACME_STORE storage area of imagectn which is
running on the host dbhost (attached to port 5678, as in step 9).  The
AE title which storescu uses (via the -t option) and the host on
which it is running must match the values known to imagectn in
its imagectn.cfg file.  See .../dcmtk/dcmnet/docs/storescu.txt for more
information on the storescu application.

Step 11:

On the remote machine used in step 10 you can start a DICOM Storage
SCP which is capable of receiving images.
e.g.

	storescp -v 3456

will start storescp in verbose mode listening on port 3456 for
incoming associations.  See .../dcmtk/dcmnet/docs/storescp.txt for more
information on the storescp application.

Step 12:

You can try using the ti application to examine the database storage
areas and send images to the storescp application started in step 11.  
ti should be run on the same host as imagectn.
e.g.

	ti -c /home/dicom/db/imagectn.cfg acmeCTcompany

will start the ti application using the configuration file you created 
and edited in steps 3..8, with the capability to communicate to the
applications defined by the symbolic name acmeCTcompany.  You can
use the "database" command to select a database, the "title" command
to select a remote application, "echo" to send an echo message, and
"send study" to transmit a complete study.  See ti.txt for more
information on the commands accepted by ti.
